## Pico Introduction

### Assignment Description

Make the onboard LED blink indefinitly.

### Wiring

No wiring needed. 

### Code

### Reflection

very easy assignment, was able to find a site with exactly what i needed.  

## Launchpad Part 1

### Assignment Description

In Launch Pad Part 1, you need to make a countdown from 10 seconds down to Liftoff (at 0 seconds). That countdown must be printed to the serial monitor in VS Code.

### Wiring

No wiring for this assignment.

### Code

### Reflection

This Function will be very useful for me in the future, the ability to count down is very important. I had the time.sleep in the wrong place and was confused why it wasn't working, until Mr: Miller helped me understand why it needs to be in the loop and not seperate. 

## Launchpad Part 2

### Assignment Description

In Launch Pad Part 2, you need to make a countdown from 10 seconds down to Liftoff (at 0 seconds). That countdown must be printed to the serial monitor in VS Code. A green light should blink throughout the countdown, then a red light is turned on until liftoff

### Reflection

I took this assignment very slow, because I didn't motivate myself to truly think about what I was doing, and just zoned out until I was offered help. That won't be happening anymore. The big thing I had a problem with was the second LED, because I didn't realize it was as simple as putting a 2 at the end of it.

## Launchpad Part 3

### Assignment Description

Make Launchpad 2 work when a push button is pressed. 

### Code

### Reflection

The wiring for the button was much more simple than I thought it would be, with only two wires and my LEDs positioning being a little bit different. I had everything I needed for my code, but I just needed to but them together in the right order and take my red LED out of my "if true" function. I also had a bad button at the beginning of the assignment, so it wouldn't work even when the code was right.

## Launchpad Part 4

### Assignment Description

Yes

### Wiring

### Evidence

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!


## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Each time the serial monitor prints a new number, blink a red LED. Once the countdown reaches Liftoff, turn on a green LED (not the onboard LED) and leave it on.
