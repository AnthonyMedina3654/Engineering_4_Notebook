## Pico Introduction

### Assignment Description

### Reflection

very easy assignment, was able to find a site with exactly what i needed.  

## Launchpad Part 1

### Assignment Description

In Launch Pad Part 1, you need to make a countdown from 10 seconds down to Liftoff (at 0 seconds). That countdown must be printed to the serial monitor in VS Code.

### Evidence

### Wiring

### Reflection

This Function will be very useful for me in the future, the ability to count down is very important. I had the time.sleep in the wrong place and was confused why it wasn't working, until Mr: Miller helped me understand why it needs to be in the loop and not seperate. 

## Launchpad Part 2

### Assignment Description

In Launch Pad Part 2, you need to make a countdown from 10 seconds down to Liftoff (at 0 seconds). That countdown must be printed to the serial monitor in VS Code. A green light should blink throughout the countdown, then a red light is turned on until liftoff

### Reflection

I took this assignment very slow, because I didn't motivate myself to truly think about what I was doing, and just zoned out until I was offered help. That won't be happening anymore. The big thing I had a problem with was the second LED, because I didn't realize it was as simple as putting a 2 at the end of it.

## Launchpad Part 3

### Assignment Description

Make Launchpad 2 work when a push button is pressed. 

### Code

### Reflection

The wiring for the button was much more simple than I thought it would be, with only two wires and my LEDs positioning being a little bit different. I had everything I needed for my code, but I just needed to but them together in the right order and take my red LED out of my "if true" function. I also had a bad button at the beginning of the assignment, so it wouldn't work even when the code was right.

## Crash Avoidence 1

### Assignment Description

We had to wire and code a accelerometer, and have it return x, y, and z axes on the serial monitor. 

### Wiring

### Reflection

This assignment went much faster than the ones in the past, because I changed my mindset and have been able to take healthy breaks. The biggest help for this assignment was the bit of code I found that I was able to modify to fit the this assignment. 

## Crash Avoidence 2

### Assignment Description

We had to wire and code a accelerometer, and have it return x, y, and z axes on the serial monitor. We then make an LED turn on when it reches 90 degrees, and off when its no longer 90.

### Wiring

### Reflection

I had almost all the knowledge I needed to do this assignment, except for one key piece. I did not know how to issolate just the "Z" in mpu.acceleration. I asked Mr. Miller and he explained that it was like numbers, and Z was number 2. So I was able to Issolate and put an if statement on it, saying if Z is below 0, then turn on the LED. If Z is above 0, then keep LED off. 

## Crash Avoidence 3

### Assignment Description

We had to wire and code a accelerometer, and have it return x, y, and z axes on the serial monitor. We then make an LED turn on when it reches 90 degrees, and off when its no longer 90. Now you will add an onboard OLED screen to print live angular velocity values.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Each time the serial monitor prints a new number, blink a red LED. Once the countdown reaches Liftoff, turn on a green LED (not the onboard LED) and leave it on.
